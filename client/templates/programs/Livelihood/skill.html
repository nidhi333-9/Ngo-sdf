                        The large population of underprivileged youth residing in rural areas and urban slums lack or
                        possess negligible vocational skills. This prevents them from taking advantage of the vast
                        employment opportunities in the cities of India. Therefore, many youth living in Rural and Urban
                        communities remain unemployed or under-employed. Skill training is one of the most powerful
                        tools for making a lasting impact on the lives of these young people and their families. The aim
                        is to make them self-reliant and in-still Changemaker qualities in each one of our students.
