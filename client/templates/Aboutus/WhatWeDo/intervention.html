                Our approach focuses on mobilizing resources—human, economic, and natural—for sustainable, life-changing
                initiatives. We use an asset-based community development approach that encourages self-reliance and
                inspires appreciation of existing resources in the community and the confidence to build upon them. We
                constantly challenge ourselves and others to do more with what we have. We believe that with an attitude
                of resourcefulness, positive change is possible even in low-resource settings.
